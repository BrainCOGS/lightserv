	<h5> What does this Core Facility do? </h5>
	<p>
		The Brain Registration and Histology Core Facility is one of the five cores of <a href="https://www.braincogs.org/">BRAIN CoGS</a>. In this core, we perform whole-brain clearing and imaging for a variety of tissue types upon request. See our <a href="{{ url_for('main.gallery') }}">gallery</a> for example tissue types. The Core Facility currently supports the following clearing protocols: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SD7Em1Hig9eqgY01sz32iqfu-SBjG9YyEk1p3b87P64/edit"> iDISCO+ (adapted from Renier et al. 2016) </a> | <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LCdtg3Oo4yUEtXIgyCGAkY0bxOy5aVWlp9KhWynShoA/edit"> iDISCO for nonoxidizable fluorophores </a> | <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VZ9Gb4zZ2XE8hVll51anp1W9twEeV55qpHd4lH6DJIo/edit"> iDISCO for nonoxidizable fluorophores (for rats) </a> | <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FNjP-gRaAzC5M_o6v68njg0njyqg2I3DRVzlUveIqm0/edit"> uDISCO (adapted from Pan et al. 2017) </a>. The imaging facility consists of a <a href="https://www.lavisionbiotec.com/products/UltraMicroscope.html">Lavision Biotec UltraMicroscope II</a> light sheet microscope to provide aligned, volumetric images. This optical microscope has four imaging resolutions (1.1x, 1.3x, 2x and 4x) and four wavelength channels (centered at 488, 555, 647 and 790 nm).

	<h5> How to use this portal? </h5>
	<p>
		If you are interested in using the Core Facility's services, please fill out a <a href="#">new request form</a>. A "request" is a collection of tubes from a single species that you would like cleared, imaged and processed. In the form, you will be asked to provide the details of your request, such as how many tubes you have and the clearing and imaging parameters to use for each tube. These parameters can be different for different tubes within a single request, but in general it is a good idea to group tubes that are in some way related in a single request. For example, a single request could be brains from 10 mouse subjects coming from the same behavioral experiment. You may request up to 50 tubes in a single request.
	</p>

	<h5> What data products do we provide? </h5>
	<p>
		The default data products are raw light sheet images at each image resolution and wavelength specified when you filled out the request form. You can also elect to use our automated processing pipeline which combines the raw light sheet images ("blending"), stitches multiple tiles together if present, then downsamples and registers the images to a reference atlas, provided that an atlas is available for the species in your request. The Core Facility currently supports two versions of the Allen Brain atlas (pre and post-2017) as well as an in-house light sheet atlas (the "Princeton Mouse Atlas"; Pisano et al., in prep.) that provides superior registration precision for light sheet data. The processing pipeline runs on <a href="https://npcdocs.princeton.edu/index.php/Spock">spock </a>, a high performance computating cluster. Note that any processing you elect through the new request form will count against your pock karma as if you ran the job yourself (see <a href="https://npcdocs.princeton.edu/index.php/Spock#The_Slurm_Scheduler">https://npcdocs.princeton.edu/index.php/Spock#The_Slurm_Scheduler</a> or contact pnihelp@princeton.edu for more details).

		At your <a href="{{url_for('requests.all_requests')}}">Requests</a> page, you will see an overview and status updates on all of your requests ongoing and completed requests. The parameters of your clearing and imaging data are automatically stored in a datajoint database upon your completion of the new request form for access external to this site. Contact us for more details.
